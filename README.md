I am an Electronics and Computer Engineer with a Master's degree (MSc) from Ben-Gurion University, specializing in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
My thesis focused on a purchasing system for laser micro-communicators in space. The research was conducted under the guidance of Prof. Nathan Kopeika and resulted in two published articles that received significant acclaim.

I have over 20 years of professional experience in the industry, specifically in algorithm development and software implementation. 
I have worked on algorithms in the fields of signal processing, image processing, computer vision, and machine learning (including Deep Learning).
Often, I have worked on projects that integrated multiple domains. In many of these projects, my work involved implementing the algorithms in software, utilizing various software tools.
